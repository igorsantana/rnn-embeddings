# Masters Project

## Jointly learning music embeddings with Recurrent Neural Networks

This repository contains all the code that I did during my masters @ State University of MaringÃ¡. I do not intend to add new features to this project, as I will not continue this project in a PhD. To better understand what is the goal of this project, this quote is from my thesis and summarizes what I did: 

> This work's goal is to use Recurrent Neural Networks to acquire contextual information for each song, given the sequence of songs that each user has listened to using embeddings. 


If you have any doubts about the code, or want to use it in your project, let me know! I will be glad to help you in anything you need.
